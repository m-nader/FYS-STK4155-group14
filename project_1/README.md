# FYS-STK4155 - Project 1

Group members: Helene Lane and Manuela Leal Nader.

Description of the project:
     - The aim of the project is to implement and compare three regression methods: Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge and Lasso.
     
Installation of packages required: Run the following command in your terminal. 
     - pip install -r requirements.txt
