# FYS-STK4155 - Project 2

Group members: Helene Lane and Manuela Leal Nader

## Description of the project:
    - The aim of the project is to develop a neural network to be applied to a regression (Approximating Runge's function) and classification tasks (Using MNIST and Fasion MNIST datasets).

## Required packages
Run the following command in your terminal to install the required packages. 
     - pip install -r requirements.txt


## Code folder
    - functions.py - contains functions used in this project, such as Runge's function, activation functions and others
    - figures.ipynb - generates the figures from the regression part of the project
    - neuralnetwork_fashion_mnist.ipynb - FFNN on Fashion MNIST dataset
    - neuralnetwork_mnist.ipynb	- FFNN on MNIST dataset
    - neuralnetwork_runge.ipynb - FFNN on approximating Runge's function
    - neuralnetwork_runge_activation_functions-ipynb - FFNN with different activation functions for approximating Runge's function
    - nn_class.py - Neural Network class for regression cases
    - nn_class_classification.py - Neural Network class for classification cases

## Figures folder
Contains the figures from the project used in the report.

## LLM folder
Contains chatlogs from LLM use if relevant.
